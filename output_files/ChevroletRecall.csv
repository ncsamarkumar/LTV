When the vehicle is started, the ECL unlocks the steering system.  The vehicle is designed so that if the column fails to unlock when the vehicle is started and the customer tries to drive, the fuel supply will be shut off so that the vehicle cannot move when the vehicle cannot be steered.  If voltage at the powertrain control module is low or interrupted, however, the fuel shut off may not occur and the vehicle can be accelerated while the steering system is locked.   Also when the control system shows that the ECL is unlocked and the vehicle is being driven, the lock pin location can vary.  depending on the location of the lock plate relative to the switch transition point, there could then be contact between the lock plate and pin causing the steering to lock while driving .","If this occurs, a crash could occur without warning.","On vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission, the dealer will disable the steering column lock by removing the column lock plate.  When the ignition key is removed, the transmission shifter will lock but the steering column will not lock.

Yes,complete,FUEL MODULE RESERVOIR ASSEMBLY,05V155,2005-04-14,Certain trucks and sport utility vehicles were built with fuel module reservoir assemblies that contain fuel pump wire connectors that may overheat under certain operating conditions.,"If the ignition circuit wire is exposed, the fuel pump fuse will blow, disabling the fuel pump and causing an engine stall or no-start condition.  If sufficient heat is conducted to the pass-through connector, a hole in the connector may result, which may cause a 'Service Engine Soon' light to be illuminated during the emission system diagnostic routine.  Fuel vapor and in some cases  liquid fuel may leak out of the fuel tank through the hole in the connector body.  Fuel leakage, in the presence of an ignition source, could result in a fire.  Also if the ignition circuit or ground wire is exposed and shorts to the fuel level sender card wires, inaccurate fuel level readings may result.","Dealers will remove the fuel tank, and remove the module reservoir assemblies from the tank, and install a new service kit free of charge.",3GNEC16T1YG143395,2023-03-06 23:48:37.919829

Yes,complete,SUNROOF SWITCH COMPLIANCE,15V164,2015-03-18,"General Motors has decided that certain 2013 – 2015 model year Chevrolet Malibu vehicles equipped with power-operated roof panel systems fail to conform to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 118, “Power-Operated Window, Partition, and Roof Panel Systems.” The roof panels in these vehicles will auto-close when the non-recessed portion of the “Slide” or “Tilt” switches are pressed and the roof panel is open.  Because these switches are not fully recessed, they can be actuated when performing the test procedure set forth in S6(a) of FMVSS No. 118, which results in the roof panel auto-closing when open.","Because the switch fails the test procedure set forth in S6(a) of FMVSS No. 118, the switch may be more susceptible to an inadvertent actuation, which could result in unintended auto-closure of the roof panel, increasing the risk of injury.  The roof panel does have an auto-reverse feature intended to prevent injury from unintended closure, but this feature may not protect against all injuries in every circumstance.",Dealers will reflash the Body Control Module (BCM) free of charge. The revised software will remove the “one-touch” (momentary actuation) feature for certain switch positions.,1G11D5SL0FF104225,2023-03-06 23:48:46.564092

When the vehicle is started, the ECL unlocks the steering system.  The vehicle is designed so that if the column fails to unlock when the vehicle is started and the customer tries to drive, the fuel supply will be shut off so that the vehicle cannot move when the vehicle cannot be steered.  If voltage at the powertrain control module is low or interrupted, however, the fuel shut off may not occur and the vehicle can be accelerated while the steering system is locked.   Also when the control system shows that the ECL is unlocked and the vehicle is being driven, the lock pin location can vary.  depending on the location of the lock plate relative to the switch transition point, there could then be contact between the lock plate and pin causing the steering to lock while driving .","If this occurs, a crash could occur without warning.","On vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission, the dealer will disable the steering column lock by removing the column lock plate.  When the ignition key is removed, the transmission shifter will lock but the steering column will not lock.

Yes,complete,ELECTRIC POWER STEERING ASSIST,14V153,2014-03-31,"General Motors has decided that a defect, which relates to motor vehicle safety, exists in some 2008 model year Chevrolet Malibu, Pontiac G6, and Saturn Aura vehicles equipped with electric power steering (EPS). The subject vehicles equipped with EPS may experience a sudden loss of power steering assist that could occur at any time while driving.","If the power steering assist is lost, a message is displayed on the Driver Information Center and a chime sounds to inform the driver. Steering control can be maintained, as the vehicle will revert to a manual steering mode, but would require greater driver effort at low vehicle speeds, which could result in an increased risk of a crash.",Dealers will replace the EPS motor controller unit free of charge.,1G1ZH57BX8F211650,2023-03-06 23:48:49.199990

On these vehicles, the tabs on the transmission shift cable end may fracture and separate.","If the tabs were to fracture and separate, the shift lever and the actual position of the transmission gear may not match.  The driver would be able to move the shifter to 'PARK' and remove the ignition key, but the transmission gear may not be in 'PARK.'  the vehicle may not be able to be restarted and the vehicle could roll away after the driver has exited the vehicle, resulting in a possible crash without prior warning.",Dealers will install a retainer over the cable end or replace the shift cable as necessary free of charge.,1G1ZH57BX8F211650,2023-03-06 23:48:49.201712

Yes,complete,BRAKE LAMP MALFUNCTION,14V252,2014-05-14,"General Motors has decided that a defect which relates to motor vehicle safety exists in 2004-2012 Malibu, 2004-2007 Malibu Maxx, 2005-2010 Pontiac G6, 2007-2010 Saturn Aura vehicles.  On these vehicles, over time an increased resistance can develop in the Body Control Module (BCM) connection system and result in voltage fluctuations or intermittency in the Brake Apply Sensor (BAS) circuit that can cause service brake lamp malfunction.  As a result, the service brake lamps may illuminate when the service brakes are not being applied, or may not illuminate when the service brakes are being applied.  Additionally, cruise control may not engage.  If cruise control is engaged, additional service brake pedal travel may be required to disengage it.  Service brake pedal application may not be required to move the shift lever out of PARK, or additional service brake pedal travel may be required to move the shift lever out of PARK.  Traction control, electronic stability control, and panic braking assist features, if equipped, may be disabled.  Service ESC and/or Traction Control tell-tales may illuminate with this condition.",These conditions may increase the risk of a crash.,"Dealers are to attach the wiring harness to the BCM with a spacer, apply dielectric lubricant to both the BCM and harness connector and on the BAS and harness connector, and relearn the brake pedal home position free of charge.",1G1ZH57BX8F211650,2023-03-06 23:48:49.204327
